		  		  <div class = "subtitle">A list of restaurants reviewed by a UC Berkeley alum (Updated Dec 22, 2016).</div>
            </br>
            <div class = "paragraph">Restaurants</div>
              After choosing to go to Berkeley, I made it a point to go to every single restaurant around Berkeley's campus. This list contains most of the restaruants with a rating, but if you have any additional suggestions please don't hesitate to contact stheakanath [at] gmail [dot] com!
              </br></br>
							<b>900 Grayson (American) - $$ - 9.5/10 - &hearts;</b>
							<div class ="review">First time trying out chicken and waffles and holy moly this was the best thing that entered my mouth. Don&rsquo;t wimp out and just do one topping, make sure you get both the syrup and the soup topping. One of the best places in Berkeley as well. <br/><br/>
							Recommended: Demon Lover (Chicken and Waffles)</div>
							<b>Algorithm (Coffee Shop) - $$ - 5/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Was in a period of trying every single coffee shop in Berkeley, and Algorithm was recommended by a friend. Didn't like their Chai as much as I wanted to. Ambiance is great though!</div>
							<b>Angeline&#39;s Louisiana Kitchen (Soul Food) - $$ - 8/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Super super good. Feels like good Southern food even though its a bit on the more expensive side. Dont expect to be productive after you have a nice meal from here.<br/><br/>
							Recommended: Hush Puppies and Ribs</div>
							<b>Artichokes Basille Pizza (Pizza) - $ - 2/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Excellent drunk food. Very oily and fatty though. This is a regular for all Cal students, so nothing much to be said here. Pizza wise I think it is average. </div>
							<b>Artis (Coffee Shop) - $$ - 8/10 - &hearts;</b>
							<div class ="review">If you're not a boba fan check out Artis. Studied here for my finals during my last semester at Cal and they make amazing coffee + great study space. All their coffee is grinded on the spot and they source from the best.<br/><br/>
							Recommended: Vanilla Iced Latte</div>
							<b>Asha Tea House (Boba)&nbsp;- $ - 9/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: AMAZING Tea. Hands down best tea in Berkeley. They use real materials in their tea so it&rsquo;s great.</div>
							<b>Bear Ramen House (Ramen) - $ - 7/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Their kimchi noodles were really good!</div>
							<b>Berkeley Sushi House (Sushi) - $ - 3/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Okay sushi if you want a quick bite and everything else is close. Not the best sushi in Berkeley, however. </div>
							<b>Berkeley Thai House (Thai) - $ - 3/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Not that great, way better thai options elsewhere. I&rsquo;d recommend the Sticky Rice with Mango and watch Ankit eat it however. 10/10 for entertainment.</div>
							<b>Bette's Oceanview Diner (American) - $$ - 7/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Situated on 4th Street, Bette's gives you a classic feel of a diner. The Souffle Pancake is amazingly soft and not too sweet, making it a good breakfast.<br/><br/>
							Recommended: Souffle Pancake (any flavor)</div>
							<b>Bleecker Bistro (Brunch) - $ - 6/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Really good breakfast food. Got the orange juice and eggs with toast. Super yummy</div>
							<b>Bongo Burger [Northside] (Burger) - $ - 6.5/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Regular place after Soda discussions. Their Mushroom burger is pretty good with the ranch sauce. <br/><br/>
							Recommended: Mushroom Burger</div>
							<b>Brazil Cafe (Sandwiches)&nbsp;- $$ - 9.7/10 - &hearts;</b>
							<div class ="review">Holy this is bloody amazing. EVERY SINGLE PERSON MUST COME HERE. Have never gotten a better sandwich. Order the Pedro Favorite Tri Tip Sandwich!!! It will not disappoint. <br/><br/>
							Recommended: Pablo's Special Sandwich</div>
							<b>BurgerMeister (Burgers) - $ - 2/10 (for food), 8/10 (for shake)</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Recommended by Nik, their burgers are not as tasty as described by him. However the milkshakes are GODLY. </div>
							<b>The Butcher's Son (Vegan Sandwiches)- $$ - 8.0/10 </b>
							<div class ="review">Everything in this restaurant is vegan, and their sandwiches are amazing. They make fake meat and manage to do it so well you don't recognize that it's vegan. <br/><br/>
							Recommended: Steak and Cheese, Eggnog, Cannoli</div>
							<b>Cafe Durant (Mexican) - $ - 2.5/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Okay mexican food, but you can get better elsewhere (ahem La Vics). Apparently it&rsquo;s good for after hangovers?</div>
							<b>Cafe Milano (Cafe) - $ - 5/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Good place to sit down and read a book! Food isn't that good however.</div>
							<b>Caffe Strada (Cafe) - $ - 5/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Cute coffee shop on Bancroft and College. Good for reading and just relaxing. Food isn&rsquo;t great here. </div>
							<b>Cal Gyro (Mediterranean) - $$ - 1.5/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Pales in comparison to Dyar. Food isn&rsquo;t as &ldquo;flamboyant&rdquo; enough/the meat hasn&rsquo;t sucked in the seasoning well enough. Do yourself a favor and go to the infinitely more superior Dyar. </div>
							<b>Cancun (Mexican)&nbsp;- $$ - 9/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: By far the BEST Mexican restaurant I have gone to. Their quesadillas beat La Vics by a mile. Also their vast amount of choices for their sauces makes the experience even better. Although expensive, this is the place to go for quesadillas. </div>
							<b>Cheese n&rsquo; Stuff (Sandwiches) - $ - 3/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Okay sandwich place. Came here because sandwiches were super cheap and was right next to Unit 3. Get their roast beef! It&rsquo;s pretty good</div>
							<b>Cheese Board (Pizza) - $ - 7.5/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Great pizza place -- much better than its counter part, Sliver. They give a new pizza everyday and you really can't go wrong with their options. Don't forget to get their green sauce! </div>
							<b>Chengdu Style Restaurant (Chinese) - $$ - 7/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Super authentic Chinese restaurant! Reminds me of Cupertino Village. I&rsquo;d definitely recommend going here with a group of 5 people.</div>
							<b>Chez Panisse (French) <span class="c7">&nbsp;- $$$$ - 10/10 - &hearts;</b>
							<div class ="review">Finally got to go here after a long time of deliberation. After paying a $150 (each person) meal, we were presented with a menu of theirs. They started off with grape juice which was by far the most marvelous juice I ever drank and proceeded with their raw fish. The raw fish had some spices that were hard to describe but again melted in your mouth. This endless course kept on going in the end...and it was an experience definitely worth living out again. The most memorable item was the chocolate crepe. The crepe was a mix of the right amount of burnt which hightened the taste to a different level. They showed us the kitchen afterwards and the process of making the food. Would go here again for a special occasion. <br/><br/>
							Recommended: Daily Menu</div>
							<b>Cinnaholic (Desserts) - $ - 7/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Tasty stuff! Great after Linguistics lecture (hehe)</div>
							<b>CREAM (Ice Cream) - $ - 3/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Nice and cheap. OK ice cream.</div>
							<b>Crepes a Go-Go (Crepes)&nbsp;- $$ - 8/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Although expensive, their crepes are super super good. Sweet crepes don&rsquo;t match San Francisco&rsquo;s counterpart on Pier 39, but their savory crepes are on a whole different level. The clashing of sweet and savory tastes give an exciting adventure into the French world. Nice and cozy date place too if you wanna get intimate. </div>
							<b>Crunch (Korean) - $ - 6/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Good for a one time try, their kimchi rice is very very good. The rice soaks in all of the seasoning so each bite wants you to take more. &nbsp;</div>
							<b>Crossroads (Dorm Dining) - $ - 0/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Rating speaks for itself.</div>
							<b>Daily Pint (Bar/Grill) - $ - 7/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Really tasty burgers and hot dogs, can&rsquo;t go wrong with any choice really. Was a regular place to bond with Vish freshman year.</div>
							<b>Dot Island Grill (Korean) - $ - 3/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Disgusting unhealthy fried food. Makes you feel terrible every time. Would recommend as a one time thing but not every single damn time. </div>
							<b>Dumpling Express (Chinese) - $$ - 5/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Super tasty food! Reminds me of the restaurants in Cupertino Village (but doesn&rsquo;t come as close). </div>
							<b>Dyar (Mediterranean)&nbsp;- $ - <span class="c7 c8">7/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: One of the better mediterraneans food in Berkeley. Food is healthy and super tasty. Hummus plate is the best dish here. They give a healthy amount of meat with onions and pita bread. Great option if you want to eat (somewhat?) healthy.</div>
							<b>Elmwood Cafe (Cafe) - $ - 5/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Got the hot chocolate, was very picturesque and a great place to sit down and read a book by yourself. <br/><br>
							Recommended: Hot Chocolate</div>
							<b>Freehouse (American) <span class="c7">&nbsp;- $$ - 6/10</b>
							<div class ="review">I would call this place the Berkeley version of BJ Brewhouse. Across Cafe Strada, this place is nicely hidden and consists of some good brew items. Great place to chill at.<br/><br/>
							Recommended: All items</div>
							<b>Gather (American)<span class="c7">&nbsp;- $$ - 10/10 - &hearts;</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: By far the best restaurant I&rsquo;ve been to at Berkeley. Everything in the restaurant is locally grown and they have a changing menu every season. This is one of those places where you should dress decently well (not college casual, but not formal), and it would be an excellent date spot. <span class="c7">My favorite place in Berkeley.<br/><br/>
							Recommended: Breakfast Pizza, Acme Walnut French Toast</div>
							<b>Gordo Taqueria (Mexican) - $ - 3/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Good mexican food but not as good as La Vics. Burritos suck but their quesadillas are okay.</div>
							<b>Great China (Chinese) - $$ - 7/10 - &hearts;</b>
							<div class ="review">Described as the opposite of Chengdu, Great China gives authentic Chinese food in a less spicy fashion. Definitely recommended as well with fair prices for their meals.<br/><br/>
							Recommended: Pork and Brocolli, Fried Rice
							<b>Gregoire (American / Sandwiches)<span class="c7">&nbsp;- $$ - 7/10 - &hearts;</b>
							<div class ="review">They have some pretty solid sandwiches even though it's a bit on the more expensive side. Nice small shop for a cute date. Get the potato puffs, they melt in your mouth.<br/><br/>
							Recommended: Fried Buttermilk Chicken Filet, Crispy Potato Puffs</div>
							<b>Gypsy&rsquo;s Trattoria Italiano (Italian) - $ - 4/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Good italian food, but makes you feel very heavy and fat afterwards. Recommend the clam dish (forgot what it was though)</div>
							<b>Hong Kong East Ocean Seafood Restaurant (Chinese / Dim Sum)- $$ - 7/10 - &hearts;</b>
							<div class ="review">Need a good date place and a nice view of the Berkeley marina? Head on over to to HKEOSR. They have classic dim sum lunches.</div>
							<b>Homeroom (American) - $$ - 7/10 - &hearts;</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Interesting Mac and Cheese place, they have so many different variations. Definitely an experience worth trying, but you&rsquo;ll feel very heavy afterwards. <br/><br>
							Recommended: Gilroy Garlic Mac n' Cheese</div>
							<b>House of Curries (Indian) - $ - 3/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Used to be good, until I discovered IFE. </div>
							<b>IB Hoagies (Sandwiches) - $ - 6/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Hidden treasure, get their cheese steak sandwich. Makes you feel bad but holy it's a taste explosion.
							<br/><br/>
							Recommended: Cheesesteak Hoagie Sandwich</div>
							<b>Icis (Ice Cream) - $ - 7/10 </b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Decent ice cream, the cone is just right, but the ice cream feels like there&rsquo;s just something wrong. When you lick it it immediately melts, whereas I like to swish the cream around my mouth before letting it in. The flavors change every day so that&rsquo;s that, but it isn&rsquo;t like &ldquo;oh my gosh this is the best ice cream ever&rdquo;. </div>
							<b>Ikes (Sandwiches)&nbsp;- $ - 9.5/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Best (non-steak) sandwich you can get in the entire world. Nothing else needs to be said.</div>
							<b>Indian Flavors Express (Indian) - $ - 7/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: By far the best Indian food in Berkeley. My regular to go place.</div>
							<b>Joshu-ya Brasserie (Sushi) - $$$ - &hearts; - 9/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Amazing sushi, but absurdly expensive. Great date spot too. Both of us came here to celebrate our freshmen Apple and Facebook offer.</div>
							<b>Kaze Ramen (Ramen)&nbsp;- $ - &hearts; - 8/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Dishes are a bit too salty but they are pretty good. The beef is very soft and literally falls off. I recommend getting double egg and double beef. Decent replacement to the ramen back home. Not as good as Orenchi however. </div>
							<b>Kimchi Garden (Korean) - $ - 3/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Not great. Portions are small and they overspiced some of their meats.</div>
							<b>King Pin Donuts (Dessert)&nbsp;- $ - 9/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Ahhhh, first late night walks trying to stuff custard donuts into her mouth to hanging out after a long run or going there after getting drunk, King Pin has been the glue to the paper. Everything here is good, and never forget.</div>
							<b>Koja Kitchen (Korean) - $$ - &nbsp;7/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Koja is interesting in the sense they put their meat in a fried noodle bun. Great mixed culture food and food gives a great punch but can get tiring if eaten often.<br/><br/>
							Recommended: Kamikaze Fries </div>
							<b>Koryo Restaurant (Korean) - $ - 4/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: I bought some sort of stew with beef. The beef is very soft and falls out of the bone, but the soup is overall very very bland. I&rsquo;d definitely recommend going if you are sick/congested however. </div>
							<b>La Burrita (Mexican) - $ - 3/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Semi-okay Mexican food. Pancho&#39;s is a better alternative but La Vics over all. </div>
							<b>La Note (French) - $$ - 9/10 - &hearts;</b>
							<div class ="review">A nice French-styled restaurant, and they have quite excellent breakfast items. Definitely get the morning bun here and one of the pancakes. <br/><br/>
							Recommended: Lemon Gingerbread Pancakes, Morning Bun</div>
							<b>La Mediterraine&eacute;&nbsp;(Mediterranean) - $$ - &hearts; -&nbsp;9/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Got the Fillo combination plate, the combination of sweet and savory was the best thing ever. Great date spot as well. <br/><br>
							Recommended: Fillo Combination Plate, Chicken and Fillo</div>
							<b>Muracci&#39;s Japanese Grill (Don, Japanese) - $$ - 5/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Tastes like frickin&rsquo; Maggi. The donburi bowl that Nik bought tasted good however. Rice had a sweet taste infused within the meat given. Don&rsquo;t get the curry bowls though, it tastes EXACTLY like Maggi.</div>
							<b>The Melt (Sandwiches) - $$ - &nbsp;7/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Super expensive sandwiches for tiny portions but food is very very good. They change their menu seasonally. I&rsquo;d definitely recommend their in house root beer!</div>
							<b>Montagues (Sandwiches) - $ - &nbsp;7/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Go to sandwich place. Not as good as Ikes but decent alternative. </div>
							<b>Nanayiro Restaurant (Sushi)</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Amazing sushi, albeit a bit expensive. Forgot which plates are good, but abience and all sushi places were amazing. Great date place too.</div>
							<b>Noodle Theory (Thai)&nbsp;- $$ - 8/10 - &hearts;</b>
							<div class ="review">They also use locally grown items, everything here is good you can&rsquo;t really go wrong with what&rsquo;s on the menu. I recommend some variation of the garlic noodles. Better and more expensive alternative to Toss Noodle Bar. 
							<br/><br/>
							Recommended: Garlic Chicken Noodles</div>
							<b>Northside Cafe (Cafe);- $ - 6/10 - &hearts;</b>
							<div class ="review">Try out their baked potato! Super good on a cold day. Also a great place to work at. 
							<br/><br/>
							Recommended: Baked Potato</div>
							<b>Obe Town Chicken (Korean) - $$ - 7/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Need your fried chicken fix? Head on over to Obe Town. They serve massive portions of chicken that you can share with 4 people with just two orders. I recommend the dry chicken. Don't forget the cheese corn -- this stuff is the icing on the cake. <br/><br/>
							Recommended: Gan Jang Chicken, Cheese Corn</div>
							<b>Pat Browns (Dorm Dining) - 1/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Who doesn&rsquo;t love free cookies? </div>
							<b>Pieology (Pizza) - $ - &nbsp;3/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Mediocre pizza, but better than options in Berkeley. I don&rsquo;t understand why our entire friend group likes this so much. Gives option to customize the pizza.</div>
							<b>Pizzahhh (Pizza) - $ - 3/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Mediocre pizza on northside, would not recommend. </div>
							<b>Pho KK (Pho) - $ - 6/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Getting sick? Check out Pho KK. The best Pho place you can get in Berkeley, you can really go wrong with any item on the menu here.</div>
							<b>Pancho&#39;s (Mexican) - $ - 4/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Only good mexican food in Berkeley, but still not as good as La Vics. Ponchos sauce is really good. </div>
							<b>Platano (Salvadoran) - $ - 6/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Reminds me a lot of Mexican food, but a really really interesting experience to try out. Get the Pupusas with various fillings. <br/><br/>
							Recommended: Pupusas</div>
							<b>Purple Kow (Boba) - $ - 5/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Can&rsquo;t go wrong with this! Super good boba.</div>
							<b>Quicklys (Boba) - $ - 1/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Clearly you can go wrong with this! I feel like I&rsquo;m getting diabetes every time I drink Quicklys. They use powder and not real materials in their boba. </div>
							<b>Rachas (Thai)&nbsp;- $ - 8/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Best thai food you can get in Berkeley. All of their dishes are really good and I haven&rsquo;t been disappointed by any of them</div>
							<b>Ramen Shop (Japanese/Ramen)&nbsp;- $$$, &hearts;&nbsp;- 9/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes [visited 8/17/14]: Amazing. I&rsquo;ve never had better ramen anywhere else. The bowls change everytime so you can&rsquo;t go wrong on what you get. Note that price is crazy though. Each ramen bowl was $20. Awesome date spot. </div>
							<b>Seniore&rsquo;s Pizza (Pizza) - $ - 7/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Their pizza was created for drunk people who can&rsquo;t taste anything. Crust is hard, uneven and they use too much tomato sauce. They do have nice tricks when they throw up the pizza in midair though!</div>
							<b>Share-tea Berkeley (Boba) - $ - 8/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Ahhh ShareTea my love.</div>
							<b>Sheng Kee Bakery (Bakery)&nbsp;- $ - 8/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: I love this bakery. Chinese bakery with my favor egg custards &lt;3</div>
							<b>Sliver (Pizza) - $ - 1/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: They use weird-ass ingredients, never liked their pizza. However their green sauce makes their pizza somewhat tasty. Also so much damn oil in their pizza. And they always put potato which is gross.</div>
							<b>Slider Bar (Burgers)&nbsp;- $ - &hearts; - 8/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Really tasty sliders, came here with Aman one time. Make sure you mix and match. Nothing can really go wrong here! Also decent date place.</div>
							<b>Smart Alec&rsquo;s (Burgers) - $$ - &nbsp;3/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Burgers are not really that good here, and ridiculously expensive in terms of how much food you get. Veggie burger isn&rsquo;t that tasty either (as well as the meat burger)</div>
							<b>Smitten Ice Cream (Ice Cream) - $ - 6/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Super cool, they make ice cream on the spot by using liquid nitrogen. You can watch them make it. Ice cream is also tasty. </div>
							<b>Smoke&rsquo;s Poutine (Junk Food) - $ - 0/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Unhealthy beyond belief, literally just french fries with some meat sauce poured over it.</div>
							<b>Snack Shack (American) - $ - 6/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Situated in the Northside Asian Ghetto, Dan Garcia took me here for a lunch and WOW I am shocked that I didn't discover this place earlier. They change their menu every week and never cease to amaze me.<br/><br/>
							Recommended: Lamb Sliders</div>
							<b>Steve&rsquo;s Korean BBQ (Korean) - $ - 4/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Decent korean food, their beef is very tender and has the flavor infused into the meat. Would recommend once but would not come back again.</div>
							<b>Sunny Side Cafe (Breakfast) - $$ - 6/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Got The Alameda, amazing food but a bit too much food. Definitely one of the better breakfast places in Berkeley<br/><br/>
							Recommended: The Alameda</div>
							<b>Sunrise Deli (Greek) - $$ - 5/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Not too great of a Greek place, but worth getting the food once. They give pretty big portions for the price you pay.</div>
							<b>Sushi Ko (Sushi) - $ - 4/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Got Udon here with Luke but wasn&rsquo;t that great. Udon was bland so was Luke&rsquo;s bento box. </div>
							<b>Sushi Secrets (Sushi Fusion) - $ - 0/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Disgusting. They put sushi in a burrito. WTF? Took one bite and gagged. Threw the rest in the trash.</div>
							<b>Sweetheart Cafe &amp; Tea (Boba) - $ - 2/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Not as good boba when there are better options elsewhere. However they do stay open late so it&rsquo;s good if you want to go for a late night run.</div>
							<b>Tacubaya (Mexican) - $$ - 8.5/10 - &hearts;</b>
							<div class ="review">Also located in 4th Street Berkeley, this place is a gem. The portions are insanely small but WOW I've never had such amazing quesadillas. Their churros also just melt in your mouth<br/><br/>
							Recommended: Quesadilla de Pollo, Churros</div>
							<b>Tako Sushi (Sushi) - $ - 5/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Go-to sushi place! Decently priced and decent dishes, I love coming here if I don&rsquo;t want to spend too much but am craving some sushi. </div>
							<b>Tara's Organic Ice Cream (Ice Cream) - $ - 8.5/10 - &hearts;</b>
							<div class ="review">Tara’s serves unique, homemade ice cream flavors like basil, goat cheese blueberry and sweet corn. Our favorite combo? The cinnamon ice cream. It isn’t too sweet, and Tara’s unique, nutty sesame-flavored cone complements it just perfectly. If I'm honest, this is basically a frozen churro.<br/><br/>
							Recommended: Cinnamon Ice Cream on Sesame Cone</div>
							<b>Tikka Korner (Indian) - $ - 7/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: First food in Berkeley. Had this in 8th grade. The kabob was super good and seared to the right amount. Would come back and take parents here again. </div>
							<b>Tigerlily (American Indian Fusion) - $$$ - 9/10 - &hearts;</b>
							<div class ="review">Tigerlily is an interesting take on Indian food. They combine Indian elements with American breakfast food while giving it an American atmosphere. Although the food is expensive, it's worth it.<br/><br/>
							Recommended: Fried Chicken with Chicken Tikka Masala</div>
							<b>Thai Noodle 2 (Thai) - $ - 6/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Decent Thai food, but since Rachas is a bit down it makes no sense to come here. Doesn&rsquo;t mean they are bad however! </div>
							<b>Top Dog (Fast Food)&nbsp;- $ - 8/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Ahhh late night 2 am Top Dog walks. Top Dog never disappoints no matter what dog you get.<br/><br/>
							Recommended: Chicken Apple Sausage, The Original Top Dog </div>
							<b>Toss (Noodles)&nbsp;- $ - 9/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: By far the best noodle place you can go to. They give decently large portions and their menu options are forever customizable. Their noodles have soaked in the spices super well, thus giving a flavorful taste when taking every bite of the noodle. Thai Tea is a bit too small but it&rsquo;s also tasty!</div>
							<b>Troy (Greek) - $$ - 8/10 - &hearts;</b>
							<div class ="review">Troy is a classic Greek restaurant with one specialiaty: their red sauce. This red sauce is so incredibly spicy that you'll need a lot of yogurt to down your Gyro. <br/><br/>
							Recommended: Gyro</div>
							<b>T-Toust (Korean) - $ - 3/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Hidden away in the alleyway, but pretty good korean food. They give very large portions but the food gets old really quickly. </div>
							<b>Vik's Chaat Cafe (Indian) - $ - 7/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Best Indian food you can get at Berkeley. Down a bit farther from campus they serve you in the classic chaat style with decently sized portions and a sweet shop to end the day.<br/><br/>
							Recommended: Cholle Bhature, Mango Lassi, Biryani</div>
							<b>West Coast Pizza (Pizza) - $ - 6/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Can&rsquo;t go wrong with the cheesesticks. The wings are amazing however. Pizza is just eh.</div>
							<b>U Cafe (Boba) - $ - 1/10</b>
							<div class ="review">Sony&rsquo;s notes: Again, why go here when you have ShareTea nearby. Boba feels very plasticky. Didn&rsquo;t think a tea shop can get worse than Sweetheart.</div>
							<b>U Cha (Boba) - $ - 8/10</b>
							<div class ="review">The Bomberman is something else. It's consisted of popping honey boba, milk and more honey. A simple combination gets me coming back every time.<br/><br/>
							Recommended: The Bomberman</div>
