		 	<div class = "subtitle">A Guide of Places to Eat and Places to Visit (Updated: July 4, 2016)</div>
            </br>
            <div class = "paragraph">Restaurants</div>
              Starting off with a list of restaurants. Note that there won't be too many low reviewed items mainly due to the fact that we only tried the best restuarants during our time here. Nonetheless please use this list to aid you when you visit NYC!
              </br></br>
              <b>AquaGrill (Seafood) - $$$$ - 9.5/10</b>
              <div class="review">One of the most expensive restaurants, but by far the best seafood restaurant. The ambiance is amazing. We got the Seared Diver Sea Scallops and a bunch of oysters, but the price came out to be >$100 per person IIRC. But this is a must try if you visit NYC. They give you free complimentary desserts and appetizers in between so it isn't too necessary to order extra food.
              </br></br>
              Recommended: Anything on oyster menu</div>
              <b>Bagels On the Square (Breakfast) - $ - 9.0/10</b>
              <div class="review">When you come to NYC, you must get the city's legendary bagels. Usually I'm a skeptic when it comes to better bagels but this was something from a different universe. I got the Cinnamon Raison with Strawberry Cream cheese and an Everything Bagel with Lox. The bagels are so perfectly crisp yet soft and the cream cheese was made fresh in the morning. A must try when you visit.
              </br></br>
              Recommended: Everything Bagel with Lox</div>
              <b>Burger and Lobster (American) - $$$ - 10/10</b>
              <div class="review">A twist on modern restaurants, Burger and Lobster only offers three items on their menu: a burger, a 1.5 lb lobster, and a lobster roll. Our table got all three items so that we could taste everything and again, the seafood was something out of this world. The burger was a seemingly normal burger, but the lobster was perfectly steamed. Make sure you get the additional lemon and garlic butter to dip the lobster meat. I also had the lobster roll, a small yet massive taste explosion of lobster meat with horseradish sauce on a warm bun.
              </br></br>
              Recommended: Lobster Roll, 1.5 lb Steamed Lobster</div>
              <b>Creamline (Desserts) - $ - 8.0/10</b>
              <div class="review">After getting the wildly hot tacos from Los Tacos N0.1, we had to get some milk. We went to Creamline located in Chelsea Market and got their chocolate milk. The chocolate milk is freshly packaged on their farms, and it tasted like as if you were drinking melted chocolate. By far the best chocolate milk I've had in the entire US (and I have gotten a lot of milks).</div>
              <b>Dominique Ansel Bakery (Desserts) - $$ - 11/10</b>
              <div class="review">I would fly to New York from San Francisco just for this restaurant. Founded by the famous pastery chef Dominique Ansel (inventor of the cronut, frozen smore, and cookie shot, including winner of several Michellan stars for his pasteries), this bakery is a must go if you are in NYC. Get two things: the frozen smore and the cookie shot, and bask in dessert heaven. If you have time on your hands you should line up at 7 am to get their cronuts (they sell out when they open the store). Every time I visit here I feel like I can die happy.
              </br></br>
              Recommended: Frozen Smore, Chocolate Shot</div>
              <b>Halal Guys (Mediterranean)- $$ - 8.0/10</b>
              <div class="review">Notorious for taking down the hot dog scene in NYC, Halal Guys is now the next big food cart stand. Make sure to get the white sauce with the order.</div>
              <b>Ippudo (Ramen) - $$ - 6/10</b>
              <div class="review">The most reviewed restaurant on Yelp, and it does live up to its hype. The ambiance of the restaurant is really nice and for the prices of the meal you're getting a steal. The chicken wings we got were very crispy and the sauce was just right. However the ramen wasn't as good as some reviewers said.
              </br></br>
              Recommended: Fried Wings</div>
              <b>Jane's Breakfast (American) - $$ - 7.0/10</b>
              <div class="review">Recommended by some NYU students, Jane's Breakfast makes some of the best egg based brunch plates. I recommend going to Jane's during a Sunday brunch. The wait is 1 hour, but it's worth it. The poached egg was perfectly soft in addition to the pull pork that just melts in your mouth.
              </br></br>
              Recommended: Benedict Jane</div>
              <b>Joeâ€™s Shanghai (Chinese) - $$ - 8.5/10</b>
              <div class="review">Joe's is located in Chinatown. Once you get past the claustraphoic area, you'll get to the gem of Joe's Shanghai, notorious for their pork soup dumplings. Although all the other items are just average (Cupertino is better), the pork soup dumpling is something out of this world. The dumpling is made when you order and the soup explodes in your mouth when you bite into it. Haven't gotten a better soup dumpling anywhere else. 
              </br></br>
              Recommended: Pork Soup Dumpling</div>
              <b>Los Tacos No.1 (Mexican) - $ - 9.0/10</b>
              <div class="review">Also located in Chelsea Market, these are by far the best tacos I've had in America (then again I haven't had many tacos). The line is quite long but it goes through quickly. A special thing they offer is catcus tacos. Their tacos are filled with pineapples, salsa, and guac, giving it a fruity taste but fun. Note that they add some hot sauce into the taco (we had some Creamline milk afterwards)!</div>
              <b>Milk Bar (Dessert) - $ - 6.5/10</b>
              <div class="review">A hole in the wall dessert place and recommended by a friend, Milk is a very interesting take on desserts. We tried the cereal and milk frozen yogurt and it tasted exactly like cereal but in frozen dessert form. It doesn't sound as appetizing on text, but once you try the frozen yogurt, it's very refreshing.</div>
              <b>Mighty Quinn's Barbeque (BBQ) - $$ - 6.0/10</b>
              <div class="review">Located in Hudson Eats in Brookfield Place (a mall near the Hudson river), Mighty Quinn's ribs are soft, but don't come close to the amazing ribs you can get from the South. The place has great ambiance and is excellent to take with your friends.</div>
              <b>PizzArte (Pizza) - $$ - 7.0/10</b>
              <div class="review">Zagat rated, PizzArte is a famous semi-underground small pizza place that serves some amazing Margarita pizza. When we were served we were given a fork and knife, making this more high-fi (?) but we decided to be savages and eat with our hands like normal people. Although not the best pizza, it was a great experience.</div>
              <b>Qi Bancock Eatery (Thai) - $$$ - 8.0/10</b>
              <div class="review">The first restaurant I've been to in NYC, Qi's Bancock is a high end Thai restaurant with a club like ambiance that makes some pretty amazing Thai food. My friend had the green curry with rice which was seemingly normal, but we decided to try a noodle plate with seafood (I'm blanking on the name, it was their most popular dish). Man, this was one of the tastiest Thai noodle dishes I've had. The noodle was thin and had some really fresh seafood making it amazing. One issue I had was that the dish was insanely spicy, making it for a rough day the next day.</div>
              <b>Shake Shack - $$ - 9.5/10</b>
              <div class="review">The competitor to In-n-Out on the East Coast, every Californian should try out the arch-nemesis of burgers. The burger is quite expensive compared to its West Coast counterpart but their Shake Sauce and bun is what makes this burger special. Definitely a must have when on the East Coast.</div>
              <b>10Below - $ - 7.0/10</b>
              <div class="review">Also located in Chinatown, 10Below is an experience more so than the food. They take a cup of milk flavored to one of the monthly flavors on the menu, and put it on a plate that's cooled to below 10 degrees (get it?). The chef then continues to mix the milk until it becomes a roll of ice cream, where you can add any topping. Very fun to watch and you can't go wrong with any flavor.
              </br></br>
              Recommended: Matcha and Strawberry, Monkey Business</div>
              </br>
